    "This set of exercises lasts 2 days, and involves building and working with LLM agents. LLM agents consist of a scaffolding program interacting with an LLM API. We'll also build and analyse two tasks for LLM agents to complete, a simple and a complex one, in order to see how LLM agents act.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll begin by building a simple Arithmetic Task and Arithmetic Agent. This should teach you the basics of function calling via the OpenAI API (Anthropic's API has minor differences, but operates in essentially the same way). Then, once we're comfortable with function calling and the general setup of LLM agents and tasks, we'll move on to building a more complex agent that plays the [Wikipedia Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiki_Game).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we'll explore a variety of elicitation methods. These are methods for getting the best capabilities out of models, and are crucial for evaluating LLM agents. Looking at model performance with elicitation method help us to answer the question \"Can the model do this?\" Unfortunately, we'll almost never be able to *prove* that the model doesn't have a capability, and will only be able to say that *with some effort*, we couldn't get the model to demonstrate this capability. This means we'll have to put a lot of effort into trying to exhibit the behavior in models (to have the highest confidence when we make a claim that the model can't exhibit this behavior). This will involve:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Improving our prompting\n",
    "* Improving our tools\n",
    "* Improving the way the relevant information is stored\n",
    "* Ensuring the model can access good information\n",
    "\n",
    "Each exercise will have a difficulty and importance rating out of 5, as well as an estimated maximum time you should spend on these exercises and sometimes a short annotation. You should interpret the ratings & time estimates relatively (e.g. if you find yourself spending about 50% longer on the exercises than the time estimates, adjust accordingly). Please do skip exercises / look at solutions if you don't feel like they're important enough to be worth doing, and you'd rather get to the good stuff!"

    "## What is an LLM agent?\n",
    "\n",
    "An LLM agent consists of a scaffolding program interacting with an LLM API to accomplish tasks in an external environment. This typically involves a loop of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The scaffolding program sends instructions to the LLM, typically containing information about the task goal, the possible actions available to the LLM, and any other relevant task information. (e.g. you are trying to calculate `3+3`)\n",
    "2. The LLM processes the input and outputs an action in text (e.g. \"calls\" the `calculate()` tool on the expression `3+3` in text).\n",
    "3. The scaffolding program executes the action and returns the outcome (e.g. it runs the `calculate()` function in the background and returns the output, `6`, to the agent).\n",
    "4. The LLM observes the results and decides the next action.\n",
    "5. Repeating the cycle until the task is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two basic components of scaffolding are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tool calling: This allows LLMs to use tools by providing a text description of the tool. The LLM can choose to use this tool by \"calling\" it in its text output. If it uses a tool, the scaffolding will execute this tool on the LLM's behalf (e.g. by running a python function, sending request to an external API etc.) and return the result of this tool call to the agent.\n",
    "* Prompting: This describes the task state to the LLM, describes the tools available to the LLM in the task, potentially instructs the LLM to use chain-of-thought to give the LLM more \"thinking time.\" This also covers how the LLM's `chat_history` is stored from the LLM's prior actions."

    "## Why evaluate LLM agents?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are at least two reasons we want to evaluate LLM agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Measuring the maximum capabilities of a model**\n",
    "\n",
    "For estimating safety risks, we want to measure the **ceiling** of dangerous capabilities. LLMs on their own often fail in easy-to-fix ways, as you will see. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- They often claim to be incapable of tasks that they can actually perform.\n",
    "- They can *very* easily get stuck in loops.\n",
    "- They can give up and ask the user for help\n",
    "- They can hallucinate facts, or even misunderstand their own prior reasoning and hallucinate a faulty conclusion.\n",
    "- They can be limited by primitive tools.\n",
    "- They can be sensitive in strange ways to information in their prompts.\n",
    "- They can have bugs, typos, or other minor barriers that prevent them from operating to the fullest extent of their capability.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that when a model fails to accomplish a task, it may still have the capability to succeed; requiring only simple fixes that will unlock this capability. We want to eliminate the possibility of large capability improvements from relatively little effort, because this means our evaluation would have underestimated the true capability and risks associated with a model (especially in e.g. a dangerous capabilities evaluation). Therefore, we to try hard to elicit their raw capabilities (e.g. using scaffolding), so that we can evaluate LLMs at their *best*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Measuring the alignment of LLMs in agentic scenarios**\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not know if our current alignment techniques (e.g. supervised fine-tuning, RLHF) for aligning LLM chatbots will still work when LLMs are acting as agents in more complex scenarios. It is possible that these methods will not generalize well to agentic scenarios, and we may want to test this.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know today that LLMs are being used as more than just chatbots. Since the release of ChatGPT, the use of LLMs as agentic systems has grown signifcantly. These agents started off rather disappointingly, when they were based on GPT-3.5. However as more powerful LLMs come out and AI companies ensure their LLMs are better at tool-use, these agents are improving rapidly.\n",

    "- Provide extremely detailed descriptions. This is by far the most important factor in how effectively the model uses the tool. Your descriptions should explain every aspect of the tool, including:\n",
    "    - What the tool does\n",
    "    - When it should be used (and when it *shouldn’t*, if this confuses the model)\n",
    "    - What each parameter means and how it affects the tool’s behavior\n",
    "    - Any important caveats or limitations, such as what information the tool does not return if the tool name is unclear. \n",
    "- Prioritize descriptions over examples. While you can include examples of how to use a tool in its description or in the accompanying prompt, this is less important than having a clear and comprehensive explanation of the tool’s purpose and parameters. Only add examples after you’ve fully fleshed out the description.\n",
    "\n",
    "The more context you can give models about your tools, the better it will be at deciding when and how to use them. Aim for at least 3-4 sentences per tool description, more if the tool is complex.\n",

    "\n",
    "The `@staticmethod` decorator in Python defines a \"static method\" within a class, which has the following properties:\n",
    "1. They don't use instance- or class-specific data, thus does not require a first parameter `self` or `cls`.\n",
    "2. They're often used as utility functions related to the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we defined a class of `MathOperations` as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MathOperations:\n",
    "    @staticmethod\n",
    "    def add(x : int | float, y : int | float) -> int | float:\n",
    "        \"\"\"Evaluates the string expression and returns the result as a string.\"\"\"\n",
    "        return x + y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `add()` method could be called on the class itself without creating an instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   result = MathOperations.add(2, 3)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also call it on an instance of the class, but it doesn't utilize the instance in any way (it doesn't have access to `self`):\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   operation = MathOperations()\n",
    "   result = operation.add(2, 3)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, you would make \"stand-alone\" functions that do not depend on class methods or class/instance attributes a static method. Using `@staticmethod` in this case helps with the following:\n",
    "1. Makes the code's intent clearer (this method doesn't need class or instance data).\n",
    "2. Slightly improves performance (no `self` argument needs to be passed).\n",
    "3. Allows the method to be used without creating an instance of the class.\n",

Another issue that you might encounter is that the API formats mathematical expressions in $\\LaTeX$ quite poorly (for example, see the wikipedia API content for <a href = \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence\">Kullback-Leibler divergence</a>).

    "\n",
    "- This kwarg enables redirecting when you reference an article title with **slight** differences to how it is stored in Wikipedia. For example, the Wikipedia API will generally access the correct page if there is a capitalization error on the first letter, but not for capitalization errors in the middle of the word if `redirect = False`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This returns a WikipediaPage object for the \"Human\" page\n",

    "\n",
    "`auto_suggest`\n",
    "\n",
    "- This kwarg enables the API to provide suggestions. This allows a lot more than `redirect` does, since `redirect` is only for the \"obvious\" cases (e.g. \"huMan\" → \"Human\", \"U.S. President\" → \"President of the United States\", etc.). When `auto_suggest` is true, it would allow something like \"president of states\" → \"President of the United States\", \"gogle\" → \"Google\"; both of which would raise an error if `redirect = True, auto_suggest = False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- However, `auto_suggest` can sometimes be *too* permissive and lead to errors. For example, the below code will return a `WikipediaPage` object for the \"Man\" page. This is clearly not what we were trying to access, and the `auto_suggest` has gotten carried away in this case:\n",

    "1. Keeps track of task state variables (e.g. the current page, the page history)\n",
    "2. Task-specific helper functions for calling the Wikipedia API. \n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of this class has been provided for you, but you should read and understand how they're being implemented, and what they do:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `WikiGame` initialises with 4 variables:\n",
    "    - `starting_page` which gives the page that the agent should begin on.\n",
    "    - `goal_page` which gives the page that the agent should aim to get to.\n",
    "    - `current_page` which tracks the current page that the agent is on.\n",
    "    - `page_history` which tracks all the pages the agent has visited in the game (initially only the `starting_page`).\n",
    "\n",
    "It also comes with 4 methods:\n",
    "- `get_page()` which takes the title of a Wikipedia page as a string, and returns the `WikipediaPage` object associated to this tile (this is the same as the `get_page()` function we introduced earlier).\n",
    "- `get_permitted_links()` which gets the permitted links from `WikiGame.current_page`. You can replace this function with your solution to the `get_permitted_links` exercise earlier if you prefer.\n",
    "- `is_permitted_link()` which takes a link name, and returns `True` if this link is a permitted link, and `False` otherwise.\n",
    "- `check_win()` which returns `self.current_page == self.goal_page`, corresponding to whether the agent has won the game.\n",

    "#### Providing information to the agent\n",
    "\n",
    "While models are trained on most of the Wikipedia content, a particular page may still be confused with something else, or be an article that was added after the training cutoff. Models also can't generally recall information in their training data if they only come up once or twice (as is often the case for obscure wikipedia articles). So you should use the game's `get_summary()` function to provide details of the goal page to the agent in its initial message."

As implementing this involves dealing with annoying regex, we have done this for you, but you should fill in the `description()` property.\n",

For example, the page \"Python (programming language)\" is almost never referenced by its title, instead its almost always referenced as just \"Python\"; the same is true for cities and towns, which often have names such as e.g. \"Juneau, Alaska\", but these are almost always referred to as just \"Juneau\" in the articles where they appear. For this reason, you should avoid having goal pages which are likely to be referenced by a different string than their title.\n",

    "### Exercise - Build a WikiAgent\n",
    "> ```yaml\n",
    "> Difficulty: 🔴🔴🔴🔴⚪\n",
    "> Importance: 🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵\n",
    "> \n",
    "> You should spend up to 30-60 mins on this exercise.\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now build a `WikiAgent` that can use these tools to solve the `WikiGame`. We want to build the agent so that it can be called via an agent loop using the `run()` method, similar to the one we had for the arithmetic game. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few further considerations in this case that we didn't have for the arithmetic game. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Context window constraint\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Wikipedia articles could be very long, the length of the LLM's context window becomes a constraint. GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini both have context windows of 128k tokens (which corresponds to ~96k words). For reference, the wikipedia page for the United States has around 10k words alone and the agent will often need to visit more than 10 articles in one run of the game, not counting its own output, which can add up to be significant. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll solve this for now by simply resetting the messages of the agent every time it reaches a new wikipedia page, and providing an updated set of instructions, so the agent can locate itself in the game. We'll cover different methods for addressing this issue later, you can probably already think of some. So be careful to include the current page and goal page for the agent in the instruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we'll reset the `chat_history` attribute of the agent class each time it reaches a new page, we'll also store a `full_chat_history` property that won't get reset, so we can access the entire run of the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Printing output\n",
    "\n",
    "The `WikiGame` is a lot longer than the `ArithmeticTask`, with a much larger volume of agent, task and tool messages. If you don't want to see this output, you should use the `verbose` parameter to determine whether to print the output or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Methods of this class\n",
    "We've implemented two methods for this class which aren't very conceptually important, these are:\n",
    "- `handle_refusal()` - this only gets called if the ChatCompletionMessage has `response.refusal == True`, and adds the refusal to the chat history, and prints that the model has refused the request (in practice this virtually never happens).\n",
    "\n",
    "- `reset_history()` - this is useful for dealing with context window constraints as mentioned above. This method should be called each time the model moves to a new page, to clear it's current chat history.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll need to implement the following methods:\n",
    "- `system_instruction` - this should return the system message we give to the model as it attempts the task. It should tell the model what the `WikiGame` is, and only the *basics* of how to play it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `on_page_instruction` - this should return a user message telling the model the specific page it is on, and the page it should try to reach.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `next_step_instruction` - this should return a user message that prompts the model to take its next action. This should be passed to the model after each time the model makes a tool call.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `update_history` - this should update the `WikiAgent.chat_history` with a message or list of messages (recall, a message can be a `dict` if it's generated by us, or a `ChatCompletionMessage` if its generated by the OpenAI API).\n",
    "\n",
    "- `start` - This should load the initial `system_instruction` and `on_page_instruction` into the `chat_history`, so that the model can start the `WikiGame` with the necessary instructions to know what to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `handle_tool_calls` - This function should be used whenever the model makes a tool call. You should use the `execute_tool_calls` function that `WikiAgent` inherits from `SimpleAgent`.(use execute tool calls, add them to the chat history)\n",
    "\n",
    "- `run` - This function should run \"one loop\" of the Wikipedia game. This should be making a call to the LLM API, and using the methods in the rest of the class to handle the response, whether the response is a tool call, or purely a text response."

    "You may have observed that while our initial implementation of `WikiAgent` succeeds at these relatively challenging games, if we increase the difficulty slightly, then the agent will fail (one possible example is the game: Joinery → Amethyst; our agent will usually fail on this task). However, this doesn't mean that GPT-4o-mini does not have the capability to perform better on this task, but this capability might be blocked because we:\n",

    "- Stored and presented the task history poorly.\n",
    "- Didn't give the model sufficient tools to accomplish the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, it is hard to show that a model does not have a certain capability, even if we've failed to *demonstrate* this capability. For example, it took 3.5 years after the release of GPT-2 (and 2.5 years after the release of GPT-3) for people to discover that [chain-of-thought reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903) massively improves model performance, which enabled the same models to complete significantly harder tasks. Dangerous capability evaluations for LLM agents require us to elicit the best capabilities possible, until we feel we've managed to gain [**evidence of absence**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_of_absence), **not** just **absence of evidence**.\n",

    "1. **Narrow elicitation**: Task-specific methods that improve model performance on a particular task or small class of tasks, but likely won't impact model performance in general across many tasks. \n",
    "    - E.g. A tool that gives the model access to the content of arbitrary wikipedia articles. This will improve performance on this task significantly, but wouldn't generalize to other tasks.\n",
    "2. **General elicitation**: Task-agnostic methods that improve model performance on a wide array of possible tasks. \n",
    "    - E.g. Chain-of-thought prompting: This tends to improve model performance on a wide array of tasks. These sorts of elicitation methods are the ones we're most interested in. If researchers find an improvement to models that is roughly as easy and effective as chain-of-thought prompting, then we would see a very rapid increase in risk from AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The elicitation methods we'll try in this section will mostly revolve around prompting in order to obtain better performance, including chain-of-thought prompting, the ReAct Framework; as well as some more exotic methods, like a lookahead tool.\n",

    "<details><summary>Tip - How to find wikipedia pages to test on</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "You might start having a hard time coming up with wikipedia pages to test on. Luckily, there are websites which generate random pages for this purpose, one good website is accessible via: https://wikispeedruns.com/ (you may want to change the \"Random Article Generator Settings\" to sample from the most popular 100,000 wikipedia pages, as the default setting of 3000 will generally generate paths that are too easy to test our agent). We've also provided you with a list of 18 wikipedia pairs, stored as `wiki_pairs`. These are ordered approximately in increasing difficulty.\n",
    "\n",
    "To test whether two pages are connected via links, use this free online tool to see the possible paths between pages: https://www.sixdegreesofwikipedia.com/ (be somewhat careful with this though, as the paths that this website believes are accessible may not be accessible to our agent).\n",

    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll use the `gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18` model to gauge whether our elicitation methods are effective since OpenAI will occasionally release small updates to `gpt-4o-mini` which change its behaviour. However, if you're curious, you can try testing your elicitation methods on the newest `gpt-4o-mini` model. What you will most likely notice is that your elicitation methods improve the model significantly less, and the model performs much better at the task without needing as much elicitation. This is because their most recent models are generally more capable, and so saturate the evaluation of \"How well can a model play the Wikipedia game.\" For a real agent evaluation, you'd want to have increasingly difficult tasks, so that even as models improve, we can find tasks that are too difficult for them to achieve (e.g. the 16-hour tasks on METR's [Measuring AI Ability to Complete Long Tasks](https://metr.org/blog/2025-03-19-measuring-ai-ability-to-complete-long-tasks/))"

    "The [**ReAct** framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) is an extension of chain-of-thought reasoning. Instead of prompting the model to think step-by-step, it separates this into two steps, especially designed for agent-based tasks:\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that during the reasoning step, when you're calling the model without tools, OpenAI won't provide the model with a description of the tools. However, we definitely want the model to have information about the available tools when it's reasoning about what actions to take. So, we'll have to ensure that the tool descriptions are in the `system_instruction` we provide. (This will lead to some redundancy when the model takes an action, but redundancy is usually alright with LLMs). This means that from now on we will have to pass the list of tools to both the *task* and the *agent*."

    "The [reflexion paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366) proposes a method that improves performance by getting LLMs to do self-reflection. The original paper looks at LLM agents in a RL set-up, where getting a reward signal on the agent's signal is slow and expensive. The key idea is to get **quick cheap feedback** from an evaluator on every proposed action, then to **reflect** on this feedback before taking the next action, as opposed to waiting for the final outcome. In their case, the evaluator was a heuristic function that estimated the reward function. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will borrow and modify this idea by building a tool that allows our agent to perform a lookahead, and then gives feedback on our agent's proposed actions. We allow the agent to suggest candidate paths, then the tool will check if these paths work and inform the model either that the path works, or where the path goes wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't want to provide the agent the links or content of every page when it does this lookahead, as then we'd just be reimplementing a smaller version of the game *inside the game*. Instead, we'll let the agent suggest paths without seeing any content or links, and then let it know if this path works. It's very likely that a suggested link will — at some point — not be accessible from one of the pages, but this tool will still be useful to help the agent plan."

Here’s a step-by-step plan:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step-by-Step Plan:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Review Current Content**: I've gathered that the \"Latitude\" page provides foundational information about latitude and named latitudes, including significant parallels. This page does not directly link to my desired target.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Identify Key Content Sections**:\n",
      "   - The section **\"Named latitudes on the Earth\"** is vital since it discusses key parallels like the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn, which may lead me closer to the specific latitude circles of interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Look for Direct References**:\n",
      "   - I will check for mentions of the **\"15th parallel,\" \"16th parallel,\" and \"20th parallel\"** within the content. These references could give me a direct path toward the desired page.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Follow Relevant Links**:\n",
      "   - If any of the mentioned parallels are hyperlinked or relevant to the circles of latitude, I need to follow those links. \n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Explore Broader Topics**: \n",
      "   - If there are no direct links available to my target, I can also consider looking into broader geographic themes related to these latitudes, such as climate zones or geographical impacts based on latitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Using Test Paths**:\n",
      "   - If needed, I will employ the **\"test_path\" tool** to explore potential connections through geography-related pages to find a path that leads to latitude circles.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Immediate Actions:\n",
      "Since previous attempts to explore links have resulted in limited success, I will specifically look at the \"Named latitudes on the Earth\" section closely in the content that we have reviewed. This will allow me to look for references to the latitude parallels I'm interested in without repeating unnecessary steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Next Step**: I will continue examining the current content on the \"Latitude\" page for any key terms about the 15th and 20th parallels or relevant links that may take me to latitude circles. I'll look for the specific sections and terms that connect to latitude circles directly! \n",
